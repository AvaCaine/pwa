<pre><center><h4>This is a webapp, and is made to be downloaded. For computers, click the ðŸ–¥ icon in your url bar. For phones, which are the target device for webapps, you
  should have gotten a popup. If you tapped somewhere on screen like the
website, posibbly to scroll, it probably went away, to download then, go to
the three dots in the top right of your browser, tap it, then tap save to home
or whatever related text it says. After tapping, there should be 2 options, those
being some kind of "shortcut" that will open in your browser, and isnt an actual
app, and there should be one that says install app or somthing of the sorts.
At this point you probably know what to select, you should tap the option to
install app, this will install a version of the website, made as an app.
It will have contents like the website, but will be in app form/format.
For support, email createchivity@gmail.com or text 475-204-4170</h4></center></pre>
